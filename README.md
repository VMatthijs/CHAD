# Source Code Transformation Automatic Differentiation

This project gives an implementation and extension of the automatic differentiation algorithm described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05283).

## Example programs
A few example programs are available in [Examples.hs](./Examples.hs). These can be tested by first building the library (`stack build`) and then opening the file in GHCi (`stack ghci Examples.hs`).
